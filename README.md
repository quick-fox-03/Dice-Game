# Dice-Game
A simple game where dice are rolled for two players, and the player with higher score wins.

This game was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Logic for the game function : 
  create two random variables, namely decider1 and decider2 for the two players.
  the values of decider should range from 1 to 6.
  depending upon the value, change the dice image to appropriate image.
    For e.g., decider1 is '5' then change image of first dice to 5.
  compare the decider1 and decider2 values, and declare the winners accordingly.
